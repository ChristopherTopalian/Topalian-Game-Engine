Note:
// Embedding YouTube videos to our game will cause the console messages to become filled with YouTube related messages.
// To avoid console clutter, at anytime, we can comment out this line, in the whenLoaded script:
// makeRowOfWebsitesPdfsOrVideos(dataVideosChemistry, 2465, 670, 550, 550);

// By not embedding YouTube videos during development, we instead have our console available without any messages from YouTube. This makes development much easier.
