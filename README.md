# Topalian-Game-Engine
100% Pure JavaScript Game Engine made for absolute beginners to learn how to make HTML/JS games very easily! There are Two Versions: 1. Static Camera, where we design games on one screen that keeps the camera still. 2. Follow Camera,  is where the camera follows the player through the world, which is utilized for open world exploration games! Use Mozilla for the Follow Camera Version.

The EASYVersion Folder gives the total Beginner a very simple Game engine template to start with.
The EasyVersion is kept simple and will be kept in this folder forever, so that beginners can have the easiest time possible learning from the bare minimum of what is needed to make a game in JavaScript!
 
Download and Play Instructions
When you choose, CLONE, and ZIP file, you must remember to not try to run the game in the Zip folder!!!
Remember to COPY the Folder to your DESKTOP before you run it.
DO NOT RUN IT FROM THE ZIP FOLDER, because it won't load the textures or songs!!!
